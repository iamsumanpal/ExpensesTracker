If you want to add expenses or income just type in description and then give the amount. After that just press enter button and it will be automatically added. 
Thos web app shows, the balance, the income and the outcome. it also has a dashboard where the user can add a new entry (an income or an expense), he can toggle between the income list (that show only all income entries) and the expenses list (that shows only the outcome entries) and all list that shows all the entries.
The user can edit or delete an entry.
Our app has an interface, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome.

The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, or reboot his machine, he can always find  his data there.
